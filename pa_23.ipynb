    "2. Use different colors or patterns: Assign distinct colors or patterns to each figure to make them visually distinguishable. This can help viewers quickly identify and compare the different elements on the graph.\n",

    "Compound interest refers to the interest that is calculated not only on the initial principal amount but also on the accumulated interest from previous periods. It allows your investment or savings to grow exponentially over time. The benefit of compound interest over a higher rate of interest that does not compound can be explained through the concept of compounding periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interest is compounded, the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, and future interest is calculated based on the increased amount. This compounding process continues over multiple periods, resulting in a larger overall return.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a higher rate of interest that does not compound would only provide a simple linear growth. The interest earned in each period is not reinvested, and future interest is calculated based on the initial principal amount. This results in a lower overall return compared to compound interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefit of compound interest is that it allows your money to work for you over time, generating more significant returns. As the interest accumulates and compounds, the growth becomes exponential, especially when considering long-term investments or savings. This compounding effect can lead to substantial wealth accumulation over time, even with a relatively lower interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, compound interest offers the advantage of exponential growth by reinvesting earned interest, whereas a higher rate of interest that does not compound provides only linear growth. This makes compound interest a powerful tool for building wealth and achieving long-term financial goals."
